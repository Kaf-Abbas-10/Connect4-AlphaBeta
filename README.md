# Connect Four with Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project implements the popular two-player game **Connect Four**, featuring an intelligent AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning** for optimization. Developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, the game supports human vs. AI gameplay with visual representation of the board after each move.

## üß† Objective

To create an interactive, strategic Connect Four game that allows a human player to compete against a computer-controlled opponent using game tree search algorithms.
